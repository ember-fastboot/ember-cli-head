# Ember-cli-head [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ronco/ember-cli-head.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ronco/ember-cli-head)

This addon adds easy population of head tags from your Ember code
without any direct hacky dom manipulation.  This addon also provides
[ember-cli-fastboot](https://github.com/tildeio/ember-cli-fastboot)
compatability for generating head tags in server rendered apps.

The hope is that Ember itself will provide a mechanism for populating
head tags from your app at some time in the future.  Until then this
addon provides that functionality.

## Installation

Install by running

```
ember install ember-cli-head
```

## Usage

#### Template

By installing this addon you will find a new template added to your
app:

```
app/templates/head.hbs
```

The contents of this template will be inserted into the `<head>`
element of the page.


#### Service

There will be a `model` in the rendering scope of this template.  This
model is actually an alias for the `head-data` service.  You can set
whatever data you want to be available in the template directly on
that service.

### Example

#### Setting content data in route

```javascript
// app/routes/application.js

import Ember from 'ember';

const { set } = Ember;

export default Ember.Route.extend({
  // inject the head data service
  headData: Ember.inject.service(),
  afterModel() {
    set(this, 'headData.title', 'Demo App');
  }
});
```

#### Using the service as model in head.hbs

```javascript
<meta property="og:title" content={{model.title}} />
```

#### Resulting head

This will result in a document along the lines of:

```html
<html data-ember-extension="1">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <title>My Ember App</title>
    <meta name="description" content="">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

    <base href="/">

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/vendor.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/my-app.css">

    <meta property="og:title" content="Demo App">
  </head>
  <body class="ember-application">


    <script src="assets/vendor.js"></script>
    <script src="assets/my-app.js"></script>
    <div id="ember383" class="ember-view"><h2 id="title">Welcome to Ember</h2>

    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```



### Fastboot Only

The primary need for this library is to support various bots and web crawlers.  To that end the head content is only truly needed in a server rendered (ie FastBoot) environment.  However by default the library will keep the head content in sync with any transitions/data changes that occur in your Ember App while running in the browser.  This can be useful for development and/or debugging.

If you do not wish to have the head content "live" while running in browser you can restrict this library to work only in FastBoot by adding the following to your `config/environment.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = function(environment) {
  var ENV = {
    'ember-cli-head': {
        suppressBrowserRender: true
    }
  };
}
```

If you make use of this mode the content of `<head>` will be the static FastBoot rendered content through the life of your App.

### Suppress Clearing Fastbooted Head
As noted above, by default, this library will remove the server rendered head content. However, if you are injecting model/route specific css (i.e. a customer specific theme) into the head, having that removed when the Ember app boots in the browser will cause your page to lose it's styling.

This behavior can be suppressed by adding the following to your `config/environment.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = function(environment) {
  var ENV = {
    'ember-cli-head': {
        suppressClearFastbootedHead: true
    }
  };
}
```
